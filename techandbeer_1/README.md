## A friendly introduction to Ktor Server

- __Author__: Ilker Aslan
- __Description__: In this beginner-friendly talk we will summon a poor mobile developer and witness him build his first API call in Kotlin, in order to stop blaming the backend for his barely working apps. Hopefully we wonâ€™t trigger any backend developer during the process.
